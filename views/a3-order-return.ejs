        <p class="">Returns for refund are not accepted after 30 days from the date of purchase. Returned product(s) for refund must be unopened/unused and must accompany proof of purchase (e.g. receipt). Returns for refund will be subject to a 15% restocking fee. Shipping costs for returned product(s) to Apption Labs must be paid for by the User. If the merchandise qualifies for a refund, we will issue you a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and instructions on where to ship the product(s). Once the product(s) are received, inspected, and deemed returnable by Apption Labs the refund (less the 15% restocking fee) will be issued to the original payment method/platform/service. Unauthorized returns or returning a product to us that does not qualify for a refund risks forfeiture of product(s). We are not responsible for return shipments lost in transit. We are unable to issue refunds or accept returns for product(s) purchased from a retail or third party online store. Our Customer Happiness Team can only assist with purchases made through our online store, meater.com. For any questions or possible returns you have, please contact or return to the store where you originally made your purchase.
